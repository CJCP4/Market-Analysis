Fortinet
Fortinet is in the Challengers quadrant. The vendor continues to grow its market share in the WAF appliance
segment, with improved security capabilities. It is slowly catching up on the cloud WAF segment, with an initial
release in 2017.
Based in Sunnyvale, California, Fortinet is a large firewall vendor that offers a broad portfolio of security and network
solutions. The vendor’s almost 5,000 employees include approximately 1,000 in R&D. Fortinet’s portfolio includes a
firewall (FortiGate) that constitutes most of the vendor’s revenue, a WAF (FortiWeb), a threat intelligence service
(Fortinet TIS), a SIEM (FortiSIEM), and a sandbox (FortiSandbox). FortiWeb is available as a physical or virtual
(FortiWeb-VM) appliance, and on AWS and Azure IaaS platforms. FortiWeb subscriptions include IP reputation,
antivirus, security updates (signatures and machine learning models), credential stuffing defense and cloud
sandboxing (FortiSandbox).
Recent Fortinet’s corporate strategy shift articulates the concept they named “Security Fabric.” It consists of
integrating many solutions from Fortinet’s portfolio with, for example, unified visibility gained collecting telemetry
from every deployed product.
In late 2017, Fortinet launched a first version of a cloud WAF service (FortiWeb Cloud). FortiWeb 6.0, released in May
2018, integrates closely with the FortiGate FortiOS 6.0. This release adds machine learning algorithms to improve
anomaly detection, which deprecates the automatic application learning. FortiWeb now support Google Cloud and
VirtualBox hypervisor.
FortiWeb is a good shortlist candidate for organizations looking for a WAF appliance, especially when deployed in
hybrid scenarios, and for Fortinet’s existing customers.
Strengths
appliance product line.
Sales Execution: FortiWeb’s visibility in shortlists has improved, especially in Fortinet’s ■ customer base.
Capabilities: Fortinet delivers strong threat intelligence, supported by the large team of its Fortiguard Labs, a
shared resource for all Fortinet’s products. The vendor has strong ability to quickly deliver, and automatically
deploy new targeted signatures, even before the attacks have gained enough scale to be visible globally. With
FortiWeb 6.0, security analysts can search for attacks usingcommon vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) IDs.
■
Marketing Strategy: Fortinet applies the same strategy to FortiWeb that drove FortiGate’s success. It offers a
comprehensive portfolio of hardware appliances (eight models, ranging from 25 Mbps to 20 Gbps), and it wins on
good price/performance ratio. The vendor also improves its WAF by leveraging global R&D efforts, to quickly
mature its WAF solution, despite being a relatively recent entrant on the market. Recent release of FortiWeb
Cloud now offers a solution to Fortinet’s large customer base of midmarket enterprises.
■
Capabilities: FortiWeb’s recent use of machine learning algorithms to complement ad hoc signatures and detect
attacks from their behavior is promising. The syntax analysis pass on the request helps catch false alerts that
could result from the new technique.
■
Capabilities: FortiWeb is a good choice to protect file-sharing services, because it offers comprehensive options
and integration for malware detection. The WAF can inspect for malware, as well as integrate with Fortinet’s
sandboxing solutions.

Cautions
Imperva
Imperva is in the Leaders quadrant. The vendor is one of the most visible in both the appliance and cloud WAF
service segments. Imperva frequently wins on the basis of security features and innovation. Imperva can provide
strong WAF functionality as a traditional appliance and cloud WAF service, but faces stronger competition for its
cloud offering.
Imperva is an application, database and file security vendor, with headquarters in Redwood Shores, California. Its
portfolio includes database security products (SecureSphere Data Protection and Database Audit and
CounterBreach), a WAF appliance (SecureSphere WAF), and a cloud WAF service (Incapsula). Imperva also offers
managed security services and managed SOC.
SecureSphere can be delivered as physical and virtual appliances. It is also available on AWS and Microsoft Azure
marketplaces. The vendor also offers managed rule sets for AWS WAF.
In recent months, Imperva saw changes in its executive team, including a new CEO and CFO, followed by an internal
reorganization to refocus on a cloud-first strategy. The company recently announced the acquisition of Prevoty, a
RASP vendor. The vendor continued its investment in Incapsula infrastructure with new points of presence, refreshed
some SecureSphere hardware appliances, and released Attack Analytics, a new real-time event management
solution for Imperva SecureSphere and Incapsula.
Imperva is a good shortlist candidate for all kind of organizations, especially large enterprises looking for highsecurity
WAF appliances, or organizations planning to transition their applications from on-premises to the cloud.
Cloud WAF Service: Fortinet has been late releasing a first version of a cloud WAF service, which is still
unproven, especially in its ability to avoid and mitigate false alerts. FortiWeb Cloud has more limited capabilities
than its appliance counterpart, and it lacks available peer references.
■
Organization: The vendor has a modest increase of its WAF R&D department this year. Its investment in WAF
remains less important than for other products in Fortinet’s portfolio, and is relatively small, compared with some
of its direct competitors.
■
Market Segmentation: Fortinet is not yet visible in shortlists for web-scale organizations trying to protect their
core business-critical applications, and for cloud-native web applications that heavily leverage continuous
integration.
■
Customer Experience: Some customers would like Fortinet to go one step further and unify the centralized
management for WAF and firewall. Today, you need two separate management platforms for FortiWeb and
FortiGate. They also would like better documentation in the form of “how-to,” especially on recent features, and
better change control.
■
Capabilities: FortiWeb lags behind leaders in bot mitigation. The vendor does not offer, nor does it integrate with
DDoS protection service.
■
Capabilities: FortiWeb’s machine learning does not work in high-availability deployments. In the initial version, the
UI exposes a lot of the internal mechanics behind the machine learning engine. Although it compares nicely with
other vendors’ “black box” approaches, and this helps with the credibility of the engine, which can be intimidating
and lengthen the learning curve
