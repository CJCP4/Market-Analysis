SailPoint
U.S.-based SailPoint offers a software solution called IdentityIQ with several optional modules, and a separate,
cloud-architected IGA solution called IdentityNow. IdentityIQ and/or IdentityNow should appeal to organizations with
a strong governance focus, although IdentityNow is not at the same functional level as IdentityIQ. Several of
SailPoint's partners also offer a managed service based on IdentityIQ. For evaluation of this Magic Quadrant's
product/service score, we considered only SailPoint IdentityIQ.
SailPoint completed an IPO in November 2017. In the past year, SailPoint added functionality expanding the
integration of IdentityIQ with its SecurityIQ data access governance product and with other vendors' privileged
access management (PAM) solutions. The majority of its customers are in banking, securities and insurance. The
rest are distributed evenly among other verticals. SailPoint's customers are spread across the globe, with North
America and Europe leading in terms of deployments.
Strengths
Cautions
initial deployment.
Customers point out that OIG is complex to implement, exacerbated by the fact that finding, training and retaining
experienced in-house talent for Oracle's IGA product is difficult, raising requirements for long-term professional
services.
■
Customers comment negatively on OIG's ■ user interface.
A shift in focus of internal resources to work on IDCS combined with recent staff churn has caused some
complaints regarding inconsistency of ongoing support and maintenance of OIG.
■
SailPoint clients consistently note that the business user experience is a particular strong point of the solution,
and that the configurability of the product simplifies deployments.
■
A large partner network gives SailPoint momentum to sell and deploy its products worldwide. However,
customers report inconsistencies in the ability and level of knowledge of integration partners, so it is prudent to
get firm resource commitments and check references when choosing a system integrator.
■
A strong messaging focus on identity enablement and generally favorable customer references are responsible
for the strong awareness and brand recognition, and make SailPoint a commonly evaluated vendor.
■
Although SailPoint's market share is dwarfed by several larger competitors, SailPoint continues to grow faster
than the market due to the vendor's dominance in the midsize-to-large enterprise market.
■
Compared with previous years and to current market trends, SailPoint's innovation on IdentityIQ has slowed and is
mainly focused on integrating with other products.
■
The product is difficult to customize. It works best when organizations can deploy the solution by adapting to the
way it is designed rather than trying to do extensive customizing. Customers report a lack of flexibility and
complexity of extending the product to do tasks for which it was not designed.
