Dell Technologies (RSA)
RSA, a Dell Technologies business headquartered in Bedford, Massachusetts, offers its RSA Archer Suite to a broad
set of roles, and supports a spectrum of IRM use cases. RSA Archer release 6.3, demonstrated for this research, has
a set of use-case-based solutions that can be purchased independently. RSA's software can be deployed either onpremises
or in a multitenant, private hosted environment. Implementation services are available through RSA
professional services and its partners. RSA's clients are found in North America, EMEA, Asia/Pacific, Japan and
Latin America across industries such as financial services, healthcare, public sector/government, professional
services, transportation, telecommunications, retail, energy and technology. Four support centers are located in the
U.S., the U.K., India and Australia.
Strengths
Vertical Strategy: RSA sells to and supports a wide client base across ■ industry sectors.
Sales Strategy: RSA uses a maturity-based approach to segment targeted buyers. This approach can help
customers to identify IRM implementation steps and RSA to align its sales and support experts with customer
requirements.
■
Geographic Strategy: RSA offers a fuller coverage for global users and continues to invest in supporting new IRM
users outside North America. This makes the RSA Archer product a well-suited candidate for large and globally
distributed business operations.

Cautions
Time to Value: Some of RSA's references rated it less favorably in terms of deployment length, especially when
implementing the RSA Archer Platform on-premises at a global scale.
■
Product/Service: The RSA Archer Platform currently does not offer native capabilities to support enterprise legal
management.
■
Product/Service: The RSA Archer Platform scope of capabilities and features can be too complex for some small
and medium clients.
